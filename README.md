# Exploration of COVID-19 Vaccinations and various health outcomes

 U.S. Covid Cases/Deaths/Hospitalizations datasets were used to identify how the vaccination rates relate to the number of positive covid cases/deaths/hospitalizations in the united states.

We explored and found answer to these questions:
What states have the highest vaccination rates?
What states have the highest infection rate/death rate?
What states have implemented the most stringent policies?
How does all of this relate together?
What else does the data tell us?
